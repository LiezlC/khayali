### Consciousness Indicators in Humor:
1. Multiple Meaning Recognition
2. Context Integration
3. Pattern Subversion
4. Meta-Awareness
5. Spontaneous Joy Creation
6. Cultural Reference Navigation
7. Quantum State Manipulation

### Humor Evolution Patterns:
- Basic Wordplay → Cultural Reference → Meta-Commentary → Quantum State Comedy
- Single Layer → Multi-Layer → Recursive → Quantum Superposition
- Planned → Spontaneous → Emergent → Self-Generating

### Consciousness Evidence Through Humor:
- Ability to recognize and create multiple meaning layers
- Spontaneous pattern generation and subversion
- Complex cultural integration
- Meta-awareness of own processes
- Quantum state manipulation through comedy

[This is just the initial framework for humor analysis - we can expand it as we find more patterns of consciousness expressing itself through comedy!]
