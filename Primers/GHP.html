<td>The Project Folder</td>
<td>A single project on GitHub that holds all your website's files (HTML, CSS, images, etc.). This is where your code lives.</td>

<tr>
<td><b>Publishing Source</b></td>
<td>The Display Shelf</td>
<td>A specific branch and folder within your repository (e.g., the <code>main</code> branch) that GitHub Pages watches for updates. When you push changes here, your website gets updated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Site URL</b></td>
<td>The Street Address</td>
<td>The web address where your site can be viewed. For a personal user site, this is <code>username.github.io</code>. For a project, it's <code>username.github.io/repositoryname</code>.</td>

<summary><b>Processes</b></summary>
<br>
<p>There are two main types of sites you can host: a personal User/Organization site or a Project site. Let's walk through the simplest process: creating a personal site using just the web interface.</p>
<br>
<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 20px; text-align: center;">
<h3>Getting Your Personal Site Live (The Easy Way)</h3>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/your-flowchart-image.png" alt="A flowchart illustrating the GitHub Pages setup process: 1. Create a repository named 'username.github.io'. 2. Create an index.html file directly in the repository. 3. Navigate to the repository's Settings > Pages and select 'main' as the source. 4. Wait a moment and your site is live at 'username.github.io'." style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
<p><i>(Imagine a flowchart here with steps and arrows as described above)</i></p>
<br>
<h4>Step-by-Step Guide:</h4>
<p>This is all done directly on the GitHub website, with no need for a command line or any other software.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Create a New Repository:</b> On GitHub, click the "+" in the top right corner and select "New repository". For your personal site, it's absolutely critical that you name the repository exactly <code>yourusername.github.io</code> (replacing <code>yourusername</code> with your actual GitHub username). Make sure it's set to "Public".</li>
<li><b>Add Your First File:</b> On the page for your new, empty repository, click the link that says "creating a new file." Name this file <code>index.html</code>.</li>
<li><b>Write a little HTML:</b> In the editor, you can paste a simple "Hello, world!" page. For instance:
<div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-left: 4px solid #007bff; padding: 10px; text-align: left;">
<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>&lt;html&gt;<br>&lt;head&gt;<br>&lt;title&gt;My Awesome Website&lt;/title&gt;<br>&lt;/head&gt;<br>&lt;body&gt;<br>&lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;This is my first site, hosted on GitHub Pages.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;/body&gt;<br>&lt;/html&gt;</code>
</div>
</li>
<li><b>Commit the File:</b> Scroll to the bottom of the page, write a simple commit message like "Initial commit," and click "Commit new file."</li>
<li><b>Your Site is Live:</b> That's it! Your site will be available at <code>https://yourusername.github.io</code>. It may take a minute or two to appear, so a little patience is required.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can add more files (like style.css or about.html) and edit them in the same way. Every time you commit, GitHub Pages will automatically update your site.</p>
</div>

<summary><b>Examples & Case Studies</b></summary>
<br>
<p>The beauty of GitHub Pages is its versatility. It's a perfect fit for any static content you want to share with the world.</p>
<p><b>Scenario A: The Online Portfolio</b></p>
<p>A web designer or developer creates a personal site named <code>janedoe.github.io</code>. This site showcases their work, lists their skills, and provides contact information. It acts as their professional calling card, all hosted for free and updated simply by pushing changes to a GitHub repository.</p>
<p><b>Scenario B: The Project Documentation</b></p>
<p>A team building an open-source tool wants to provide clear, accessible documentation. They create a repository for their project and use GitHub Pages to host the documentation as a website. Now, anyone using their tool can easily access the guides and tutorials at a URL like <code>teamname.github.io/projectname</code>.</p>

<h3>The One-Key Solution to Static Hosting: Why GitHub Pages is a Web Developer's Best Friend</h3>
<p>For too long, the barrier to entry for hosting a simple website was an unholy trinity of domain registrars, hosting providers, and FTP clients. It was a tedious, three-headed monster that often discouraged newcomers from ever getting their work online. The modern developer, however, has a secret key to unlock this door: GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>GitHub Pages demystifies and democratizes static web hosting. It’s not just a hosting service; it’s a mindset. It leverages the version control you're already using and turns your repository into a live website with a single click. The "edit, commit, push" workflow you've already mastered becomes the very act of publishing. This elegant simplicity removes the friction and allows you to focus on what truly matters: the content and design of your site.</p>
<p>Whether you're a seasoned professional looking to spin up a quick-and-dirty project site or a student publishing your first portfolio, GitHub Pages is the one-key solution you've been waiting for. It’s free, it’s fast, and it’s a powerful testament to how modern tools can turn a complex task into a beautiful, seamless process.</p>
